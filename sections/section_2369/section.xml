  <summary>&lt;p&gt;To help guide our learning, we will refer to key questions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How prevalent are ELLs in the United States?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the difficulties associated with screening and testing ELLs for learning disabilities? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a learner and instructor choose to explore the option of testing for learning disabilities, what considerations should an instructor bear in mind?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And what are some strategies for teaching ELLs who exhibit behaviors suggestive of learning disabilities? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we explore the answers to these questions, we'll continue by reviewing some key terms that are used in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
