  <name>English language learners terminology</name>
  <summary>&lt;p&gt;Throughout this training, there are two terms we will use frequently: &lt;b&gt;English language learners&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;learning disabilities&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English language learners (ELLs) refers to individuals who are learning English as a foreign language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, ELLs are identified as having learning disabilities (LD). The term "learning disabilities" is used to refer to a wide variety of disorders that involve difficulties with listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning, or mathematical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
